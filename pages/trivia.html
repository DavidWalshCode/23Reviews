<h2>Inception</h2>

<p>
Leonardo Di Caprio was director Christopher Nolan's only choice for the lead role of Dom Cobb, expert extractor and architect of Dreams, in his Academy Award winning film "Inception". Usually directors draw up a list of multiple actors/ actresses for each role, but Leonardo was the only man Nolan and his wife/ producing parter Emma Thomas wanted for the job.

<br></br>

Christopher Nolan reveals that the members of Cobb's heist team were based on the roles of a film crew. “In trying to write a team-based creative process, I wrote the one I know.” The crew is made up of Cobb as the director, Arthur as the producer, Eames as the star, Ariadne as the production designer, Saito as a meddling studio executive, and finally, Fischer as the viewer.

<br></br>

Christopher Nolan came up with the idea for Inception when he was just 16 years and once he began working on the script it took him 10 years to get the finished product which we saw in the movie.

<h2>Borat</h2>

<p>
Borat's Kazakhstan scene's were shot in Glod, Romania.The 1000 residents of the village were told they were being filmed for a documentary about their hardships. Once the townspeople discovered the truth, they filed a lawsuit.

<br> </br>

The Foreign Ministry of Kazakhstan placed a four-page insert in The New York Times speaking of its positive attributes to combat the perceived negative publicity the Borat character was giving their country. When the president of Kazakhstan visited the White House a little over one month before Borat was released in theatres, Baron Cohen—in character as Borat—held a press conference in front of the Kazakh embassy refuting The New York Times insert and claiming the president was in the U.S. to promote Borat.

<br></br>

The FBI have a file on Sacha Baron Cohen. This is due to the large amount of reports that there was a terrorist travelling in an ice-cream van. As bizarre as this sounds Baron Cohen confirmed it in one of his interviews. "On Borat the FBI started following us,” Baron Cohen said, nonchalantly. “They got so many complaints that there was a terrorist travelling in an ice-cream van…that they started compiling a file on us.”

<h2>Tenet</h2>

<p>
One of the most memorable moments of Tenet is undoudtedly Neil's very realistic looking crashing of a plane into the Freeport. The reason for the realism in this scene is because no CGI was used in this scene. So yes, you would be correct in thinking that the only other way to create a scene so realistic would be to actually crash a plane. It was in fact cheaper to buy a retired plane and crash it than to use CGI.

<p>
The plot of Tenet deals with concept of "inversion" resulting in the cast having to recite their lines backwards for certain scenes. 

<br></br> 

Tenet is one of the most expensive original movies of all time with a budget of a staggering $205 million.

<h2>The Lord of The Rings Trilogy</h2>
<center>

<center>

<p>
Around 18000 costumes were used throughout the filming of the three movies.

<br></br>

The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is the first and only fantasy film ever to win an Academy Award for Best Picture.

<br></br>

While filming Lord of the Rings in the mountains of New Zealand, Sean Bean refused a helicopter ride to a set that was high in the mountains due to his fear of flying. He instead hiked up to the set in his full Boromir armor every day.
