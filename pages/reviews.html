<h2>Nomadland</h2>

<p>
<a href=https://www.searchlightpictures.com/nomadland/ target="_blank">Nomadland</a> is the kind of movie that could go very wrong. With Frances McDormand as its star alongside a cast real-life nomads, in lesser hands it might look like cheap wish fulfillment or showboating at its most gratuitous. Instead, director Chloé Zhao works magic with McDormand’s face and the real world around it, delivering a profound rumination on the impulse to leave society in the dust. Zhao previously directed The Rider and Songs My Brother Taught Me, dramas that dove into marginalized experiences with indigenous non-actors in South Dakota. Nomadland imports that fixation with sweeping natural scenery to a much larger tapestry and a different side of American life. Inspired by Jessica Bruder’s non-fiction book “Nomadland: Surviving America in the 21st Century,” the movie follows McDormand as Fern, a soft-spoken widow in her early 60s who hits the road in her van, and just keeps moving. The movie hovers with her, at times so enmeshed in her travels that it practically becomes a documentary. Instead, the movie develops an entrancing narrative about American alienation and the appeal of escaping society’s oppressive clutches. Zhao embraces the paradox at the center of a story that both celebrates its character’s liberation and bemoans that sad state of affairs that put her on that track. As America contends with its divided identity, Nomadland both captures the zeitgeist and embraces the fantasy of leaving it all behind for life on the road.

<h2>Time</h2>

<p>
Film has the capacity to freeze time in its tracks or make years vanish, turning a child into a young man in the space of a few frames. There’s a unique ache that comes with seeing the clock wind so frictionlessly onscreen, and director Garrett Bradley puts that sentiment to essential ends in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(2020_film)" target="_blank">Time</a>. Her documentary, filmed in Louisiana, is a portrait of the Rich family over decades, slipping from their own home-video footage to present day and back again. While matriarch Fox Rich establishes herself as an activist and business owner and her five sons grow up, her husband Rob remains in prison—an absence that washes Time with soul-deep longing. Bradley’s movie makes a case for prison abolition with irrefutable evidence of the ways in which incarceration harms so many more people than the one put behind bars.

<h2>Bacurau</h2>

<img src="../images/bacurau.jpg" alt="Bacurau" width="400" height="550">
</center>

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacurau" target="_blank">Bacurau</a> is already a contender for modern arthouse/grindhouse classic status, Brazilian filmmakers Juliano Dornelles and Kleber Mendonça Filho’s Western/horror/white-hot bullet of a movie introduces us to the good (and not so good) people of a rural village that’s been wiped off the map — literally: Almost overnight, you can’t find the town of Bacurau on satellite grids. It seems that a local politician may have sold out the populace to high-paying tourists interested in human prey for sport hunting. Except this prey has a long history of fighting back. A violent, neo-exploitation-flick slant on the ways the rich get richer and the poor get the picture, this tweaked take on the ol’ Most Dangerous Game scenario couldn’t be a more cathartic call to arms. This is what a satire looks like when you give it serrated edges and an abundance of blood splatter. This is what rage looks like when people get mad as hell — at imperialism, at capitalism, at ugly Americans, at Udo Kier — and refuse to take it anymore. Plus, you get the mighty Sonia Braga as the resident doctor with a chip on her shoulder and the spirit of Che Guevara in her heart.

<h2>Tenet</h2>
<center>

<p>
Was Christopher Nolan’s latest film, <a href="https://www.tenetfilm.com/" target="_blank">Tenet</a> the last theatrical blockbuster ever? It’s possible. If so, Tenet is a strange swan song, an eerie, dense, jargon-filled action film that takes the end-of-the-world stakes of a James Bond movie and inflates them to sci-fi proportions. The film’s unnamed protagonist (John David Washington) is barely one step ahead of the plot, which involves unseen time-traveling villains from the future who are trying to destroy our present by zapping people into the past. Watching him try to keep pace is thrilling as he dashes through magnificent set pieces, bumping into an overqualified supporting cast along the way. Nolan’s wide-screen depiction of a war against entropy itself is an oddly fitting match for the theater business teetering on the edge of extinction.

<h2>The Nest</h2>
<center>

<p>
If Lovers Rock conveys the cinematic power of a full house, <a href="https://www.ifcfilms.com/films/the-nest" target="_blank">The Nest</a> does the same for an empty one. Also set in 1980s Britain, Sean Durkin’s film is a family drama with an air of crushing, inescapable dread, one in which a family’s financial success presages a year of greed and emotional ruin. Jude Law and Carrie Coon do career-best work as a couple who move their family into a dramatic English mansion and then struggle to maintain their financial status; Durkin turns the environment against them in creative ways, making a haunted-house movie in which the ghost is crippling capitalist ambition. Even though The Nest is a character-focused drama, Durkin gives it the soundscape of a horror film, turning up every creak and groan of the house to reflect the couple’s growing fears about the future.
